 * now mandatory on new events — `scheduleStart`/`postingStart`/`startTime`/
 * `start`, earliest of whichever are present) and when the event was
 * actually initialized (`createdAt`). An event created ahead of its own
 * start time has no real data before that start, so the window doesn't
 * waste space on it; an event created (and so actually begun) after its
 * designated start — a late setup — starts the window there instead, since
 * nothing happened before that either.
 *
 * End: the most recent real dispatch activity (`getLastActivityTimestamp`)
 * — not the designated end or any "still running" backstop — so checking an
 * event's summary (or its designated end) early doesn't stretch the chart
 * out to cover dead time nothing has happened in yet.
 *
 * Events created before scheduleStart/End existed, with neither field nor
 * any recorded activity, fall back to a padded window derived from the
 * earliest/latest call log timestamp, so old data doesn't just disappear.
